# Provisioning

Inside this section you will find a series of [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/resources/get-started) playbooks, which will help us achieve the DSC(desired state configuration) on our servers.

These playbooks were written to be ran locally in your Jenkins server, but you can also create a hosts file and run it on a remote one, or many remote ones. If you wish to do that, we strongly recommend you read the documentation linked above, since it will guide you step by step through that process.
